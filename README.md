#Algorithmics

##Please, notice the project in active development. I'm going to push a bunch of updates this weekend. Thank you.

Algorithmics is a project started by my interest in implementing different algorithms and data structure with Swift language. 

This project inspired by:

- the great book [Swift Algorithms & Data Structures](http://shop.waynewbishop.com) by Wayne Bishop,
- github project [Swift algorithm Club](htps://github.com/hollance/swift-algorithm-club) by Matthijs Hollemans.
